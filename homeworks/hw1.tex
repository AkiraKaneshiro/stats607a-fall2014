\section{K-means}

In this problem, we will implement the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering\#Standard_algorithm}{K-means algorithm}. Download a test dataset ``seeds" from:\\
\url{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds} \\
In the file {\tt seeds\_dataset.txt}, there are 210 instances of dimension 7 along with a categorical label (1, 2, or 3). Download an (incomplete!) python script from:\\
\url{https://github.com/ambujtewari/stats607a-fall2014/blob/master/homeworks/assignment_one_kmeans.py} \\
Click on the ``Raw" button on the top right and save the file as {\tt assignment\_one\_kmeans.py}.

Open the python script in your favorite text editors. You will see a bunch of places where a comment says {\tt TASK x.y(.z)}. These are the places where you have to supply your
own code.\\
{\bf Important:} Please {\em don't} modify the existing code and comments! We might use automated scripts to grade your code and not following this suggestion will break those scripts.

We will now briefly describe your tasks. If something is unclear, please don't hesitate to email the instructor and/or GSI.
